#Style Report

##Style 1

###Pros

- The colours have been chosen to reflect Porsche's brand and all the visual elements are very subtle with varying transparencies and drop shadows.
- This design treatment enhances Porsche's branding so that users will know immediately where they are without visual reinforcement such as the brand name and emblem.
- The whole site design is appealing to not only the target audience, but to people who own a Porsche as well.
- A modular design allows for the elements to be styled responsively.

###Cons

- The site seems more visual and users who are there for more details won't be interested.

##Style 2

###Pros

- The site has a strong contrast that emphasizes the content.


###Cons

- The site's design doesn't allow for too much grid work such as the yellow strokes.


##Summary

I'll be choosing the visual-style-1 theme because it best represents what my users are looking for. The pictures of Porsche's various models allow the more visual learners to conduct their research at an attractive website.
