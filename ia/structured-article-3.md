The Porsche 918 Spyder is a mid-engined sports plug-in hybrid designed by Porsche and first shown as a concept at the 80th Geneva Motor Show in March 2010. The Spyder is powered by a 4.6 litre V8 engine, developing 608 horsepower (453 kW), with two electric motors delivering an additional 279 horsepower (208 kW) for a combined output of 887 horsepower (661 kW). It is the second plug-in hybrid car from Porsche, after the 2014 Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid.[2] The production version was unveiled at the September 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.[3]
The plug-in hybrid is a limited edition supercar, and Porsche plans to manufacture 918 units as a 2014 model year. Production began on September 18, 2013 (hence the name), with deliveries scheduled to begin in December 2013.[4][5] The starting price is US$845,000.[6]
Porsche unveiled the RSR racing variant of the 918 at the 2011 North American International Auto Show, which combines hybrid technology first used in the 997 GT3 R Hybrid, with styling from the 918 Spyder.[7]
