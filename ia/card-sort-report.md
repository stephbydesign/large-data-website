## Observations

- Both commented that it was fairly easy to organized the cards except for one type of grouping.
- Both participants struggled with to how to organize the car models.
- Both participants grouped the cars the same way except that one added a category called *Car Models*.
- The grouping results were exactly as I would have expected, except that I was surprised that I hadn't thought to group all the different models under one category.
- As my participants organized the cards, I felt confident that aside from the confusion of the car models, they were quickly piecing everything together.
